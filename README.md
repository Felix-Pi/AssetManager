# AssetManager 
> AssetManager is a tool I created to visualize my tradable assets like stocks, etf's and cryptocurrencies in one application. \
I just love charts and stats and after getting more and more into finance stuff I found no tool out there beeing able to display everything I wanted in one place. So i created this prototype.



*Important: I cant stress this enough: this is a **prototype / proof of concept**! Its my first project using flask and the codequality at this point is far from beeing perfect. There yet has not been one single thought concerning security related topics that went into this project.
If I find some time, there will be a completely new version*
